    "# Evaluating if increase in limit balances will lead to lower default rates by conducting AB Testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "From our initial data analysis of credit card defaults, we saw a link between people with higher limit balances with lower default percentage rate. Does high default rate correlate with low limit balances & will providing higher limit balances to customers lead to a decrease in default rates? \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Potential Solution: \n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing limit balances may potentially show a decrease in limit balances based on our initial analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Method of Testing: \n",
    "\n",
    "To test this experiment, we will implement AB Testing by increasing default percentage on a sample size of customers of 1,500 customers by 20% and will compare them to a control group of 1,500 other customers whose limit balances will not increase. \n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment will be conducted and evaluated in a 3 month period where the default rate percentage will be monitored throughout 3 months in a monthly basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The decision for this sample size was implemented by conducting a T-Test based on the current mean estimates for limit balances that we do have on customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variable of interest here is the default percentage compared between the test group (Group A) and the control group (group B). \n",
    "\n",
    "If default percentage in the test group decreases by over 10%, conclude that increasing limit balances among customers will lead to a decrease in default rates. This can be used to slowly roll out limit balance increase for other customers as well. If default rate does not decrease by up to 10% then observe for 3 more months before deciding on limit increase being a practice for existing customer groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Study:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Group A: Test Group (Limit Balance will increase by 20%) \n",
    "- Group B: Control Group (Limit Balance stays the same) \n",
    "- Sample size (A): 1,500 \n",
    "- Sample size (B): 1,500 \n",
    "- Time Period: 3 months \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampling test groups: \n",
    "\n",
    "For this experiment, we will take all users that have used their credit card at least 4 times in the past month as the starting group. \n",
    "\n",
    "This group will then be divided into sample sizes of 1,500 test group and 1,500 control group. We're using active users of credit card because users that use credit cards less than 4 times may not have enough activity to detect any changes in default rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "They will be randomly selected using a randomizer in Excel. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checklist Before Experiment: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure infrastructure is up and running:\n",
    "   \n",
    "Ensure proper formatting of email and test servers to evaluate their ability to send emails to 1,500 customers at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "Send test emails to \"dummy\" accounts before sending actual emails to ensure proper formatting and delivery. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure experiment is independent:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that experiment is not colliding with other events going on in the company (example: another experiment involving users) \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure experiment is approved / evaluated by management:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will submit the experiment proposal to management on February 15th, 2019 to ensure that it is approved and to gather any feedback before we roll out the experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Timeline of Experiment: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Randomly select users: April 1st, 2019 \n",
    "\n",
    "By April 1st, 2019, the users of the experiment will need to be selected. This will be done by a randomized machine using Excel to pick users at random. They can be distinguished by their ID #. There will be 1,500 users selected for the test group and 1,500 selected from the control group from the total of 30,000 users available. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Approve email being sent to selected customers by company's marketing group: April 10th, 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "By April 10th, 2019, the marketing group at the company needs to approve the email being sent to Group A letting them know that their limit balances has increased. Limit balance increases will also show automatically in the user's online profile for the bank. Since, all users may not use email - a physical mail copy will also be sent. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Send physical mail to Group A by April 15th, 2019: \n",
    "\n",
    "Physical mail letting group A know that limit balances has increased will be posted by April 15th, 2018. They will be made aware that the change will take place on May 1st, 2019. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Send email to Group A: April 20th, 2019: \n",
    "\n",
    "Email will be sent out to Group A on April 20th, 2019 letting them know that limit balances has increased and the change will take place on May 1st, 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate Default Rate (1st): June 1st, 2019 \n",
    "\n",
    "A month will have passed since the default rates increased. We will compare the starting default percentage to an one month percentage change and see if this is relevant by using T-Testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate Default Rate (2nd): July 1st, 2019 \n",
    "\n",
    "Two months will have passed since the default rates increased. We will compare the one month default percentage to the two month default percentage change and see if this is relevant by using T-Testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate Default Rate (Final): August 1st, 2019 \n",
    "\n",
    "Three months will have passed since the default rates increased. We will compare the two month default percentage to the three month default percentage change and see if this is relevant by using T-Testing. We will also compare starting default percentage v. three month percentage. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Metric: \n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment will be considered a success if default percentage decreases by 10% at the end of the 3 month period for Group A and no significant changes takes place in the control group. This will be evaluated by doing T-Tests in a monthly period for both groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Secondary Metric: \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also see if the average bills among customers also increase as their limit balance are increased so, we will see if there is a correlation between increased bills vs. limit balances. This will help us measure if limit balances are actually being used by the test group which in turn may provide more reasons to increase limit balance (increase spending among customers as well while ensuring lower default rates)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roll - Out: \n",
    "\n",
    "The correspondence to customers will be sent as listed on the timeline above. After the initial email is sent, the test group's activity will be monitored (i.e. their spendings / their payments) in a monthly basis and be compared to the control group. These numbers will be evaluated in a monthly basis for each group. \n",
    "\n",
    "The test group will not recieve any correspondence regarding their limit increase except for the initial email before experiment begins. The control group will not recieve any correspondence at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each month's data will be checked for statistically relevance by using T-Tests. This will be done by comparing the starting point data with each month as well as comparing the changes between each month the experiment takes place as well. This will be done for both groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the experiment, the groups will be evaluated to see if increasing limit balances at random led to decrease in default for the test group. In addition, the control group will be checked to see if the default rate stayed the same or didn't change significantlly (citing outside factors). \n",
    "\n",
    "If successful in showing decrease in default rates by 10% - the company will roll out a plan to increase default rates for another 10% of its customers by 20% (same as this experiment). This will allow customers to have flexibility and an increased spending budget and will allow increase revenues for the company based on interest rates payments as well as reduce its risk exposure if there is a link between increase limit balances and default rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "## If solution is not effective in 3 months :\n",
    "\n",
    "If solution is not effective at the first 3 month trial period then run the experiment for 3 more months for the same sample group allowing customers to spend in a larger time frame which may provide better data in terms of default rates in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no change in default rates that correspondences to increase limit balances after a 6 month period then, conclude the experiment and do not implement the increase of default balances for other customers an look for alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Email Sample: \n",
    "\n",
    "Dear [Customer Name], \n",
    "\n",
    "Your limit balance has increased from [old limit] to [new limit]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the change takes place starting May 1st, 2019. This does not have an impact on your credit score or any applicable fee for the credit card. \n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoy your increased spending limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yours, \n",
